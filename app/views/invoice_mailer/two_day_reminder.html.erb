	Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,
</p>

<p>
	I thought I'd check in with you once more to see if you'd like any help renewing your subscription to LinguaZone. I hope you've enjoyed using the site with your students over the past year.
</p>

<p>
	If you have any feedback to share about the website, too, please let me know. It's feedback from teachers like you that drives the site every day.
</p>

<p>
	You can write back (info@linguazone.com) or call me directly (610.322.9137) if you need any help renewing your subscription. Otherwise, you can do it all online from the bottom of the 'Overview' page once you login to your account.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks again for your support,<br />
	Colin
